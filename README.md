# [Bootstrap v2.3.2](http://twbs.github.com/bootstrap)

Fork of the old [Bootstrap v2.3.2](http://twbs.github.com/bootstrap), with UMD support (since this never made it to 2).

## Browserify usage example

```
// Require
var $ = require('jquery');
var dropdown = require('bootstrap2-umd/js/bootstrap-dropdown');

// And use
$('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown();
```
